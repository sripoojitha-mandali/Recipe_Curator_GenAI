# Recipe Curator: GenAI-powered Recipe Recommendation Platform

## Project Overview

The Recipe Curator is an intelligent platform that provides personalized recipe recommendations based on user inputs. Leveraging advanced technologies like Pinecone, OpenAI, Gemini, and FastAPI, the platform allows users to interact through natural language queries, such as searching for "spicy Indian curries" or "Butter Pecan Cookies." The application integrates **AWS S3**, **Snowflake** for storage, and Dockerized components to ensure scalability and maintainability.

By analyzing user queries and embeddings, Recipe Curator retrieves relevant recipes, generates suggestions, and allows users to create and manage a wishlist. It combines powerful NLP techniques and vector search engines to curate recipes tailored to user preferences, ensuring an engaging and intuitive culinary experience.

## Architecture Diagram

<img width="1046" alt="AD of recipe curator" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95fcba16-779a-4a1b-8704-4a3d4d1b8f63">


The architecture integrates a **Streamlit-based frontend** with a **FastAPI backend**, hosted on **Amazon EC2** for robust scalability. **AWS S3** is utilized for data storage, and cleaned datasets are ingested into **Snowflake** for structured querying. The embedding-based similarity search is powered by **Pinecone**, and **OpenAI's LLMs** enhance the natural language understanding of user queries, while **Gemini AI** supports query summarization. **Hugging Face models** are used for embedding generation, ensuring state-of-the-art NLP capabilities.

The user interacts with the frontend to search for recipes. These queries are passed to FastAPI, which generates embeddings for semantic understanding using **sentence-transformers** models from Hugging Face and retrieves matching recipes from Pinecone. Results are fetched from Snowflake for display on the frontend. The entire system is Dockerized for easy deployment and scalability.
